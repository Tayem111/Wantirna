Wantirna is a vast land of five mighty kingdoms, where heroes rise and legends shape the world. The north forges its people in ice and hardship, while the western seas connect bustling port towns across island-strewn waters. The heartlands thrive with towns amid rolling plains and ancient forests, sustaining the empires that rule them. But the south is a land of untamed magic, where cities shimmer with arcane power and reality bends to those who dare wield it. A realm of peril and glory, Wantirnaâ€™s fate is written by those bold enough to claim it.
