Hobgoblins are a formidable and fiercely tribal race scattered across the continent, primarily inhabiting the harsh environments of savannahs and deserts, with a few hardy tribes enduring the icy tundras. Known for their relentless warfare, hobgoblin tribes are almost always locked in conflict with one another, vying for dominance, resources, and respect. Their society places immense value on physical strength and martial prowess, often dismissing intelligence and cunning as secondary traits. This focus on brute force shapes their culture, making them formidable warriors but also prone to impulsive decisions driven by their infamous tempers.

Despite their strength, hobgoblins are often feared not just for their combat abilities, but for their volatile and prideful nature. They demand respect and are quick to retaliate against perceived slights, making them dangerous allies and even more dangerous enemies. Hobgoblins hold a particular disdain for [[Goblin\|goblins]], whom they view as weak and inferior due to their small stature—a sentiment they extend to many other small races. This arrogance is a defining trait of hobgoblin culture, reinforcing their hierarchical worldview.

One of the most striking aspects of hobgoblins is their deep-seated fear of water, particularly the ocean. This fear is rooted in their desert and savannah origins, where large bodies of water are rare and often associated with the unknown. As a result, hobgoblins avoid seafaring at all costs, leaving the oceans to other races while they focus on their endless land-based conflicts. To them, the sea is a realm of mystery and danger, best left unexplored.
