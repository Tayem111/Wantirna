## [[PC Options/Classes/Bard\|Bard]]
Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a Bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The [[PC Options/Classes/Bard\|Bard]] is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.

## [[PC Options/Classes/Cleric\|Cleric]]

## [[PC Options/Classes/Druid\|Druid]]

## [[PC Options/Classes/Monk\|Monk]]

## [[PC Options/Classes/Paladin\|Paladin]]
Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond.

## [[Ranger\|Ranger]]
Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

## [[PC Options/Classes/Rogue\|Rogue]]
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

## [[PC Options/Classes/Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]
Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
