## Backstory
Once a [[Goliath\|goliath]] noble, Jinx  fled his kingdom under mysterious circumstances. During his escape, a werewolf’s bite forced him to hack off his own leg before the curse could spread. Found adrift by the **[[Darkwater/Darkwater Pirates\|Darkwater Pirates]]**, his sharp mind and merciful nature earned him the role of [[Piracy/Pirate Ranks#**The Quartermaster**\|quartermaster]]. Now, he keeps his past locked away—though the pipe smoke he shares with Captain [[Darkwater/Crew/Gimli Stone\|Gimli]] hints at unspoken regrets. The crew knows better than to ask why a highborn lord walks among [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirates]]… but sooner or later, the past always comes hunting.
