*"A [[Piracy/Pirates\|Pirate]] might steal and plunder, but that doesn't mean he should have no heart"*

---

## Backstory
Born into the mining clans of **[[The Peninsula\|The Peninsula]]**, Gimli was different from the moment he drew his first breath—blind, in a world where sight was the difference between survival and starvation. His mother, **Lila Stone**, loved him fiercely and concealed his disability for years, teaching him to navigate the tunnels by touch, sound, and memory. But when the clan elders discovered the truth and saw how his blindness hindered his mining, they cast him out. Lila refused to abandon her son, and together they were exiled at the age of thirteen. They found refuge in **Arezia, the City of Lights**, a bustling coastal town where the glow of lanterns and the crash of waves replaced the darkness of the mines. Gimli, fascinated by the heroic tales of **The Vildars**, dreamed of joining their ranks—until they, too, rejected him for his blindness. The betrayal festered into a quiet fury, and he vowed to carve his own legend.

With nothing left to lose, Gimli turned to the sea. Alongside his closest friends—**[[Darkwater/NPC's/Tion Grandeyes\|Tion Grandeyes]]**, who became the lookout; **[[Gabriel Ascendus\|Gabriel Ascendus]]**, the parley master; and **[[Meredith Moli\|Meredith Moli]]**, who later became the quartermaster—he formed the **[[Darkwater/Darkwater Pirates\|Darkwater Pirates]]**. Despite his blindness, Gimli’s other senses were razor-sharp, and his unshakable will earned him the captain’s hat. His mother, heartbroken by his path, cut ties with him—but he never forgot her. Even as a pirate, he wore fine clothes in secret tribute to her dream of running a fashion boutique. Their crew could not grow at first, until they rescued **[[Darkwater/NPC's/Morris\|Morris]]**, a one-legged scholar adrift in a canoe. Gimli saw himself in the outcast and took him in, and Morris repaid the kindness by becoming their surgeon. A year later, the enigmatic navigator **[[Darkwater/PC's/Kíke\|Kíke]]** joined, guiding them through treacherous waters.

For years, the [[Darkwater/Darkwater Pirates\|Darkwater Pirates]] thrived—until disaster struck. Gimli, struck by a sudden heart attack, steered their ship into the rocks. Though they survived and salvaged their treasure, the crew’s faith in him wavered. Many urged him to retire, but Gimli refused to abandon the only life that had ever accepted him. Then came **the fall of [[Piracy/The Vildars\|The Vildars]]**. Despite his hatred for them, Gimli feared for his mother’s safety. He sent letters to Arezia, desperate for word of her—but only an empty envelope returned. Was it a message? A warning? Or had something worse befallen her?

Now, [[Piracy/Pirate Ranks#**The Captain**\|Captain]] Gimli Darkwater sails the Peninsula’s waters with a heavier heart, his once-unshakable confidence fraying at the edges. His crew remains loyal, but whispers of mutiny linger. And beneath his fine coat and polished demeanor, the blind pirate king hides a storm of grief, regret, and a burning need to find the truth—no matter the cost.
