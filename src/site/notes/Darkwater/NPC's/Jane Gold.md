*"Everything in life can be made better with a 'knickknack', and I'll be the one making them"*

### Backstory
Born in the coastal city of [[Attenfor\|Attenfor]] on [[Ovan Island\|Ovan Island]], Jane Gold, the [[PC Options/Races/Human\|human]] never knew her father—at least, not in person. Her mother, a storyteller with a knack for weaving grand tales, had married a retired pirate who returned to the sea before learning she was pregnant. For the first five years of Jane’s life, letters arrived sporadically from her father, filled with wild stories of distant shores and daring raids. But when the letters stopped, her mother kept his memory alive through embellished legends, painting him as a rogue with a heart of gold. Those stories, whispered by candlelight, ignited Jane’s fascination with [[Piracy/Pirates\|piracy]]—not just for the thrill, but for the freedom of the open sea.

Her childhood took a brutal turn at age thirteen when the **Howler Pirates**, a crew led by a monstrous werewolf captain, raided [[Attenfor\|Attenfor]]. As the village burned, Jane—armed with nothing but her quick mind—activated a cobbled-together contraption of mirrors, smoke, and pulleys, creating the illusion of a dragon swooping from the cliffs. The [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirates]] fled in terror, and in that moment of desperation, Jane prayed fervently to [[Religion/The Primordials/Orsalis\|Orsalis]], the Primordial of Knowledge, swearing that if she survived, she would dedicate herself to learning. The village hailed her as a hero, granting her unprecedented access to their few scholars and engineers. But [[Attenfor\|Attenfor]] was too small for her ambitions. At seventeen, she bid her mother farewell, paddled a canoe alone across treacherous waters, and arrived at the [[Lightest Enclave\|Lightest Enclave]], a Free Haven where pirates, merchants, and outlaws mingled.

She dreamed of joining a crew immediately, but reality was harsher. No captain would take a scrawny teenager with more ideas than muscle. Instead, Jane survived by selling cheap gadgets—clockwork toys, lockpicks, and smoke bombs—to sailors in taverns. It was there that [[Darkwater/NPC's/Gimli "Rock" Stone\|Gimli]], the grizzled captain of the [[Darkwater/Darkwater Pirates\|Darkwater Pirates]], noticed her knack for invention. Impressed by her ingenuity, he brought her aboard as a [[Piracy/Pirate Ranks#**The Bosun (Boatswain)**\|bosun]], a role typically reserved for seasoned sailors. But Jane proved her worth, maintaining the ship’s mechanisms, crafting traps for rival crews, and even improvising weapons during raids.

Now, at twenty, Jane has spent three years with the [[Darkwater/Darkwater Pirates\|Darkwaters]], evolving from a wide-eyed tinkerer into a formidable [[PC Options/Classes/Artificer\|artificer]]. She worships Orsalis with the fervor of someone who believes knowledge is the ultimate power, scribbling blueprints in stolen ledger books and whispering prayers over her latest inventions. Yet beneath her confidence lingers a question: _What happened to her father?_ Was he lost to the sea, or does he sail still—perhaps even among the Howlers who once tried to kill her? One day, she’ll find out. Until then, the [[Darkwater/Darkwater Pirates\|Darkwaters]] are her family, and the sea is her workshop.
