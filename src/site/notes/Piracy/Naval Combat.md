[[Piracy/Pirates\|Pirate]]

## Ships Stats

### HP
The amount of hit-points a ship has is determined by its type and is the amount of damage it can take before becoming **derelict**.

**Derelict**
When a ship reaches 0 hit-points, it is considered derelict. While derelict, the ships [[Piracy/Naval Combat#speed\|#speed]] becomes 0, and it can not take any actions unless healed above 0, or out of combat. If it get hit while derelict, roll on the derelict chart.

**Derelict Chart** (d8)
1. No effect
2. No effect
3. Sinks in 1d4 rounds
4. Sinks in 1d2 rounds
5. Sinks next round
6. Sinks now
7. *Minor Explosion.* All aboard must succeed a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw or take 2d6 force damage
8. *Major Explosion.* Ship sinks, all aboard take 2d8 force damage

### Hull
The Hull is the amount of pressure a ship can take before it takes any damage. For every action that damages the ship, roll the hull dice and remove the number rolled from the damage dealt.

### Mobility
The mobility of the ship represents its ability to steer and move. Add the value, determined by your ship, to every initiative roll taken. 

### Speed
The ships speed is the amount of hexes it can move per turn. A rotation (which can only be done once per hex) counts as one hex of movement. One hex represents 50 feet.

### Broadsides
Every good pirate crew have their walls lined with cannons. The broadside dice is the amount of damage dealt by every shot, preformed by the [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Fire Broadsides\|#Fire Broadsides]] action. The broadside range is the maximum distance a shot can be, before being an automatic miss.

### Bow
Bow is the amount of damage the ship deals when involved in a [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Ram\|#Ram]] action.

### Crew
The crew number is the minimum amount of crew members a ship can have before facing penalties. A ship with less than the minimum number can only take 1 action, voluntary or involuntary.

### Cargo
The cargo number represents the amount of slots a ship can carry. Slots can be taken by many different things that take up space on the deck of the ship, such as extra cannons, catapults or even a dining area.


## Ship Actions

### Initiative
When combat is initiated, at the beginning of every round, the captains of all ships must make an initiative roll **(1d6)** and add their [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Mobility\|#Mobility]]. Whoever rolls lowest moves first, then the highest. If the one who rolled higher moves through the path of a ship that rolled lower, it can choose to take the [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Hull\|#Hull]] action. Once all ships have moved, each ship takes their action, in order of highest rolled initiative, to the lowest. Once all actions are complete, crew members can take their actions in whatever order decided, then initiative is rerolled, and the cycle continues.

### Fire Broadsides
When this action is taken, roll the [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Broadsides\|#Broadsides]] dice to deal damage to the rival ships. If multiple ships are targeted, dice rolls can be split up, by choice of the captain, dealing different amounts of damage to the different ships. Broadsides can only be fired when the enemy ship is on the sides of the ship, and must be within 6 hexes.

### Ram
When two ships cross paths while in movement, the ship with a higher rolled initiative can choose to take the Ram action as a free action. When done, both ships must roll their [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Bow\|#Bow]] dice, and deal that amount of the amount of damage rolled to the other ship (both ships take damage, so be careful with this action). When this happens, the ship with the lower initiative loses 1 [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Hull\|#Hull]] die if the damage taken exceeds the maximum amount the [[Piracy/Naval Combat#Hull\|#Hull]] dice could roll.

### Boarding Party
If, and only if, your ship is touching another ship, the captain can demand a boarding party, where the crew boards the rival ship, and switches to melee combat. Be careful though, because the enemy crew can also board your ship.

### Drop/Weigh Anchor
The captain can choose to drop anchor, making the speed 0, or weigh anchor, allowing the ship to move again.

### Crew Member Actions
Every crew member, with a specialised roll, gets a single action after all the ships have taken all of their actions. These actions are decided based on the characters [[Piracy/Pirate Ranks\|pirate rank]].
