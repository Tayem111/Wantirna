Pirate culture is as diverse and unpredictable as the seas they sail. Pirates range from ruthless cutthroats to freedom-seeking antiheroes, with motivations as varied as their backgrounds. Drawn from all corners of the continent, they are adventurers, outcasts, and dreamers who take to the seas for countless reasons—escaping oppression, seeking fortune, or simply chasing the thrill of freedom. This melting pot of cultures, goals, and personalities creates a vibrant, chaotic society where loyalty is earned, rules are flexible, and every pirate carves their own path. Whether driven by greed, idealism, or sheer wanderlust, pirates share a common bond: the call of the open waves and the promise of a life unbound by landlocked laws.

### Terrors Passage
The treacherous waters of [[Terrors Passage\|Terrors Passage]], a vital sea route that separates Mainland Wantirna from [[Regions/Ovan Island\|Ovan Island]]. The passage has earned its ominous name not just from its natural dangers, but from the countless pirates who call it home. This lawless stretch of ocean is a haven for buccaneers, privateers, and outlaws of all kinds, drawn by the lucrative trade routes that pass through it and the countless hidden coves perfect for ambushes and hideouts. Coastal settlements live in constant fear of raids, while merchants brave enough to sail these waters do so at their own peril. Terror’s Passage is more than just a geographic feature—it’s a symbol of the chaos and freedom that define pirate life, where every ship that enters must be prepared to fight, flee, or forge alliances to survive.

### Safety
[[Piracy/Locations/Free Haven\|Free Havens]] are the vibrant, chaotic heart of pirate life, sprawling coastal or floating cities built by pirates, for pirates. Scattered throughout [[Terrors Passage\|Terrors Passage]], most are found on remote islands, with a few on [[Regions/Ovan Island\|Ovan Island]] and even fewer on the mainland. These bustling hubs offer everything pirates need: raucous taverns, bustling markets, cozy inns, and massive docks capable of hosting hundreds of ships. Here, crews rest, resupply, trade plunder, and share tales of their adventures, all while reviling in the freedom these cities embody. The population is a diverse mix of pirates, escaped convicts, retired adventurers, merchants, and even the occasional family seeking refuge from mainland laws. Despite their rough exterior, Free Havens are places of unexpected camaraderie, where anyone, regardless of their past, can find belonging and a taste of the pirate’s life.

### The Guards of the Sea
The [[Piracy/The Vildars\|The Vildars]] were once the elite guardians of the seas, a formidable force tasked with maintaining order and peace across the waves. Revered by coastal cities for their ability to protect trade routes and settlements from pirate raids, they were seen as heroes who kept the chaos of the ocean at bay. However, among pirates, the [[Piracy/The Vildars\|The Vildars]] were widely despised, viewed as corrupt enforcers who abused their power and demanded bribes to turn a blind eye. Despite their controversial reputation, their presence ensured a fragile balance on the high seas.

Three years ago, the [[Piracy/The Vildars\|The Vildars]] fell. Since their disappearance, the oceans have become a far more dangerous place. Without their watchful presence, piracy has surged, coastal cities live in fear, and the once-patrolled trade routes are now lawless frontiers. The fall of the [[Piracy/The Vildars\|The Vildars]] left a power vacuum that no one has been able to fill, and their absence is felt by all who sail the waves, for better or worse.

### Honour Among Thieves
[[Piracy/Code of the Passage\|Code of the Passage]] is a loose set of guiding principles embraced by pirates who sail the mystical seas of the Shattered Isles. Rooted in the chaotic freedom of pirate life, the Code emphasises fairness, loyalty, and respect for the sea while leaving plenty of room for individual interpretation. It exists not as a rigid set of laws, but as a shared understanding among free-spirited sailors—a way to maintain order without stifling the wild, adventurous nature of piracy. By following the Code, pirates aim to keep their crews united, their luck strong, and their plunder plentiful, all while honouring the unpredictable forces of the sea that both bless and challenge them.

### Social Structure
The [[Piracy/Pirate Ranks\|Pirate Ranks]] of the is a fluid yet functional hierarchy that balances authority with freedom. At the top is the Captain, the decisive leader, supported by the Quartermaster, who ensures fairness and crew representation. The Ship’s Mage handles magical matters, while the Navigator guides the ship through treacherous waters. The Bosun maintains order and the ship’s condition, and the Crew forms the backbone, with roles like Lookouts, Surgeons, and Powder Monkeys ensuring smooth operations. Beyond the ship, [[Pirate Lords\|Pirate Lords]] rule fleets and regions, while the [[Piracy/Locations/Free Haven\|Free Haven]] serves as a neutral hub for trade and diplomacy. This structure, infused with magical elements and a touch of chaos, reflects the pirates’ blend of loyalty, independence, and respect for the sea’s mysteries.
