*Guidelines for those who sail the mystical seas of [[Terrors Passage\|Terrors Passage]], inspired by the whispers of chaos and the freedom of the open waves.*

---

#### **Article I: The Captain Leads, but the Crew Decides**

The Captain’s word carries weight, especially in battle or when quick decisions are needed. But every [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirate]] has a voice, and major decisions—like where to sail or whether to attack—are often put to a vote. A good Captain knows when to listen to the crew.

---

#### **Article II: Share the Spoils**

Loot is meant to be shared, not hoarded. The Captain and Quartermaster usually take a slightly larger cut, but everyone gets a fair piece of the pie. Magical items are up for grabs, but it’s considered good form to let the Ship’s Mage take a look first—cursed treasure is bad luck for everyone.

---

#### **Article III: Respect the Sea**

The sea is both friend and foe. Offer a tribute to Neryssa before a big voyage—rum, gold, or something shiny. It’s not about fear; it’s about respect. Those who ignore the sea’s whims might find themselves battling storms or worse.

---

#### **Article IV: Don’t Kick the Helpless**

[[Piracy/Pirates\|Pirates]] are free souls, not monsters. Leave the innocent alone—kids, healers, and folks who show kindness don’t deserve trouble. But merchants, nobles, and rival [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirates]]? Fair game. A [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirate]]’s gotta eat, after all.

---

#### **Article V: Parley is Sacred**

When someone calls for Parley, you hear them out. No blades, no tricks—just talk. It’s a chance to settle disputes without bloodshed. Breaking Parley won’t get you punished, but it’ll earn you a reputation as a backstabber, and no one trusts a backstabber.

---

#### **Article VI: Watch Each Other’s Backs**

A crew is a family, and families stick together. Abandoning your mates in a fight is a surefire way to lose their trust. Pirates might be scoundrels, but they’re loyal scoundrels.

---

#### **Article VII: Magic is a Wild Card**

Enchanted items and relics are part of the job, but they’re unpredictable. Let the Ship’s Mage take a look before you start waving that glowing sword around. If it’s cursed, toss it overboard—no one needs that kind of trouble.

---

#### **Article VIII: First to See, First to Claim**

The pirate who spots a prize first gets a little extra something when the loot is divided. It pays to keep your eyes sharp and your wits sharper.

---

#### **Article IX: Feast Under the Moon**

When the full moon rises, it’s time to celebrate. Share food, drink, and stories with your crew. It’s a night of peace and camaraderie—no fighting, no grudges, just good vibes.

---

#### **Article X: The Code is a Suggestion**

The Code of the Azure Veil isn’t carved in stone. It’s a set of ideals, not rules. Pirates are free to follow it or ignore it, but those who live by the Code tend to find more friends—and more treasure—on the open seas.
