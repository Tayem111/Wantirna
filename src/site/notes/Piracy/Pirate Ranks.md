#### **1. The Captain**
**Role:** The ultimate authority on the ship, responsible for making major decisions, leading raids, and navigating the crew through danger.
**How They Rule:** Captains are often chosen by merit, charisma, or sheer force of will. Some rule with an iron fist, while others rely on the respect and loyalty of their crew. A Captain’s word is final during battle, but they often consult the crew for major decisions.

#### **2. The Quartermaster**
**Role:** The second-in-command and the voice of the crew. The Quartermaster handles disputes, distributes loot, and ensures the Code of the Azure Veil is followed.
**How They Rule:** They act as a balance to the Captain’s authority, representing the crew’s interests. In some crews, the Quartermaster holds more power than the Captain when it comes to day-to-day matters.

#### **3. The Ship’s Mage**
**Role:** The magical expert of the crew, responsible for handling enchanted items, warding off curses, and using magic to aid in raids or navigation.  However, most crews do not have one.
**How They Rule:** While not a traditional leader, the Ship’s Mage wields significant influence due to their unique skills. They often advise the Captain and Quartermaster on matters involving magic or the supernatural.

#### **4. The Navigator**
**Role:** The master of charts, stars, and currents. The Navigator ensures the ship reaches its destination, whether it’s a hidden cove or a wealthy merchant vessel.
**How They Rule:** Navigators are highly respected for their knowledge and skill. A good Navigator can mean the difference between treasure and disaster.

#### **5. The Bosun (Boatswain)**
**Role:** The taskmaster of the crew, responsible for maintaining the ship, managing supplies, and keeping the crew in line during daily tasks.
**How They Rule:** The Bosun is often feared for their sharp tongue and sharper discipline, but they are essential to keeping the ship running smoothly.

#### **6. The Crew**
**Role:** The backbone of the ship, made up of sailors, fighters, and specialists like gunners, cooks, and carpenters.
**How They Rule:** While individual crewmembers have little authority, together they hold significant power. A united crew can challenge a Captain’s decisions or even stage a mutiny.

#### **7. The Lookout**
**Role:** The eyes of the ship, responsible for spotting danger, land, or potential targets from the crow’s nest.
**How They Rule:** Lookouts are often young or agile crewmembers, valued for their sharp eyes and quick reflexes.

#### **8. The Surgeon**
**Role:** The healer of the crew, responsible for patching up wounds, treating illnesses, and performing surgeries when necessary.
**How They Rule:** Surgeons are often eccentric but deeply respected for their life-saving skills. They operate with a degree of autonomy, as their work is too important to be interfered with.

#### **9. The Powder Monkey**
**Role:** Typically a young or inexperienced crewmember, responsible for handling gunpowder and ammunition during battles.
**How They Rule:** Powder Monkeys are at the bottom of the social ladder but are often protected and mentored by the crew, as they represent the future of piracy.

#### **10. The Parley Master**
**Role:** A skilled negotiator and diplomat, responsible for handling truces, alliances, and trades with other crews or settlements.
**How They Rule:** The Parley Master is often a smooth talker with a silver tongue, able to charm or deceive their way out of trouble.
