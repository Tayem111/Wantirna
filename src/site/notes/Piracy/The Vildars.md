The Vildars were once the elite guardians of the seas, a formidable force tasked with maintaining order and peace across the waves. Revered by coastal cities for their ability to protect trade routes and settlements from [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirate]] raids, they were seen as heroes who kept the chaos of the ocean at bay. However, among [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirates]], the The Vildars were widely despised, viewed as corrupt enforcers who abused their power and demanded bribes to turn a blind eye. Despite their controversial reputation, their presence ensured a fragile balance on the high seas.

Three years ago, the The Vildars fell. Since their disappearance, the oceans have become a far more dangerous place. Without their watchful presence, piracy has surged, coastal cities live in fear, and the once-patrolled trade routes are now lawless frontiers. The fall of the The Vildars left a power vacuum that no one has been able to fill, and their absence is felt by all who sail the waves, for better or worse.
