A sprawling floating [[Piracy/Locations/Free Haven\|Free Haven]] anchored to a cluster of jagged rocks in the middle of **[[Terrors Passage\|Terrors Passage]]**, Driftwood Cove is a marvel of [[Piracy/Pirates\|pirate]] engineering. Built from the salvaged remains of shipwrecks, the city bobs and sways with the waves, connected by a network of rope bridges, wooden planks, and floating platforms. The constant creak of wood and the salty spray of the sea give the city a unique, lively atmosphere.

#### **Key Locations**
**The Kraken’s Maw Tavern**  
 The most famous tavern in Driftwood Cove, known for its rowdy patrons and legendary rum. The tavern is built inside the hollowed-out skull of a kraken. The bar is run by **[[Captain Marrow\|Captain Marrow]]**, a retired pirate with a peg leg and a pet parrot that squawks insults at customers. The tavern is a hub for rumours and secrets. The walls are adorned with maps and trophies from famous pirate exploits, and the floor is stained with the spilled drinks of a thousand brawls.

**The Floating Bazaar**  
A chaotic marketplace built on interconnected rafts and ships, where pirates trade everything from stolen goods to exotic artefacts. Vendors shout over each other, hawking their wares, while pickpockets weave through the crowd.
The bazaar is a treasure trove of unique items—enchanted weapons, cursed trinkets, and rare spices. However, buyers must beware; some items come with unexpected consequences.

**The Shipwright’s Sanctum**
A massive dry dock where ships are repaired and refitted. The sanctum is run by **Grimshaw**, a grizzled dwarf with a talent for crafting ships that can outrun the wind. The air is filled with the sounds of hammering, sawing, and the occasional explosion as Grimshaw tests new inventions. Grimshaw is always looking for rare materials to improve his ships, and he’s willing to pay handsomely for them. He’s also a source of information about the latest naval technologies and the weaknesses of rival ships.

**The Tidepool Inn**
A cozy inn built on a stable platform near the edge of the city. The inn is known for its warm atmosphere and the soothing sound of waves lapping against its foundations. The owner, **Mira**, an escaped convict who offers free lodging to those who share a good story.
The inn’s common room is filled with adventurers and pirates swapping tales, making it a great place to gather information or recruit crewmates. Mira also has a hidden stash of maps and journals from her travels, which she might share with those she trusts.

**The Lighthouse of the Lost**
A towering lighthouse built on the highest rock in the city. The lighthouse is manned by **Old Salty**, a blind seer who claims to communicate with the spirits of the sea. The light is said to guide lost souls to safety, but some whisper that it also attracts darker things.
