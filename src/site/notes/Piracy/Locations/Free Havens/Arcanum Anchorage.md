*Arcanum Anchorage is where piracy meets the arcane—a city of stolen knowledge, animated clutter, and reality itself up for grabs.*

---

Perched on the jagged cliffs of [[Regions/Ovan Island\|Ovan Island]], overlooking [[Terrors Passage\|Terrors Passage]], this [[Piracy/Locations/Free Haven\|Free Haven]] is built within the ruins of an ancient arcane university, its old towers and libraries now repurposed into a haven for pirates, scholars, and rogue mages. Ley lines converge here, warping reality—books float mid-air, spells misfire unpredictably, and ghostly echoes of wild magic surges travel through the air.

## Key Locations

### The Spellsworn Tavern – "The Runaway Lectern"
A tavern built inside the ruins of a grand **lecture hall**, its walls covered in half-erased spell diagrams and chalkboard scribbles that shift when no one’s looking. The bar is an old **enchantment altar**, and drinks are served in beakers that change flavor with every sip.
**Why It’s Interesting:** The house drink, **"Leyline Gin,"** is brewed from magical runoff—drinkers gain a random cantrip effect for an hour (or sprout temporary scales). The owner, **Marlo the Unbound**, is a former professor who teleports when startled.

### The Living Library
The **grand archives** of the fallen university, now a labyrinth of floating books, sentient grimoires, and whispering scrolls. Knowledge-seekers barter **gold, secrets, or memories** for access.
**Why It’s Interesting:**
- **The Forbidden Stacks:** A roped-off section where books **bite** and some contain **trapped souls** (willing to bargain for freedom).
- **The Atlas of Lost Ships:** A massive tome that updates itself with the **real-time locations** of sunken vessels (for a steep price).

### The Pocket Docks
Instead of traditional moorings, ships are **shrunk down** into palm-sized replicas via an ancient **compression spell** and stored in a warded vault. The fee is **10 gold per day**, and captains receive a tiny **ship-in-a-bottle** to carry with them.
**Why It’s Interesting:**
- The spell sometimes glitches—a few ships return **slightly cursed** (e.g., crewmembers now have **peg legs made of cork**).
- Pirates who skip payment find their ship **stuck at 1/100th scale** until they settle debts.

### The Scholar’s Rest Inn
A repurposed **dormitory**, where rooms are **pocket dimensions** (some bigger inside, others missing a wall). The innkeeper, **Lira**, is a **chronomancer** who may accidentally check guests into "last Tuesday."
**Why It’s Interesting:**
- Guests report seeing **their own past/future selves** in the halls.
- The "Honeymoon Suite" is a **time-looped** room where the bed never feels slept in. 

### The Broken Atelier

A workshop where **artificers** and rogue mages tinker with unstable magic. The air smells of ozone and burnt feathers.
**Why It’s Interesting:**
**Krix**, the gnome artificer, sells:
- **Spellshards** (one-use spell crystals)
- **"Golem Crewmates"** (dissolve at dawn, but great for heavy lifting)
- A **cannon that fires delayed-fireball runes** (disclaimer: may ignite user’s eyebrows)

## Unique Features

- **The Leyline Heart:** A **cracked arcane core** in the city square. Touching it fills you with wild magic—but remember that you did it of your own will if things turn sideways.
- **The Familiar’s Den:** A hidden bar where **familiars and constructs** drink (served by a talking owl named **Baroness Beak**).
- **The Unwritten Wing:** A section of the Living Library where books **write themselves** based on visitors’ thoughts.

## Mood & Atmosphere
**By Day:** The air shimmers with residual magic. Floating debris casts drifting shadows. Scholars and pirates argue over **"ethical looting"** of spellbooks.
**By Night:** The ruins glow with **arcane auroras**. Phantom lecturers debate in dead languages, and the **Bridge of Echoes** hums with half-remembered spells.
